Alright, so I need to align two medical terminologies using different terms. The user has provided both sets of terms and wants me to map each term from the second set to its corresponding term in the first set if they're similar.

First, let's take a look at the first terminology. It includes:

- Thoracic spondylosis
  - Abnormally opaque structure (morphologic abnormality)
  - Lung hypoinflation
  - cardiomegaly
  - Cardiomegaly
  - Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)
  - Paratracheal lymphadenopathy (UMLS)
  - Lung hyperinflation
  - Cardiomegaly

The second terminology includes:

- hyperinflated lungs
- flattened diaphragm
- increased retrosternal airspace
- pulmonary edema due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- spine dextrocurvature
- bronchiectasis
- fibrotic scarring
- heart size is normal
- acute respiratory distress syndrome
- mild cardiomegaly
- thoracic spondylosis
- ards
- infiltrate in the right middle lobe
- heart enlargement (pulmonary edema)
- left diaphragm elevation
- no acute pleural effusion abnormalities

Now, I need to map each term from the second set to the first. Let's go through them one by one.

1. **hyperinflated lungs**: This seems related to lung hyperinflation in the first terminology. So, hyperinflated lungs maps to cardiomegaly and possibly hyperinflation itself.
   
2. **flattened diaphragm**: In the first term, there are two entries for flattened diaphragm: (1) flattened diaphragm (morphologic abnormality) and (2) flattened diaphragm (diastereomony). I'm not sure which one is more appropriate here. Maybe both can map to the same meaning.

3. **increased retrosternal airspace**: This sounds like a part of lung hyperinflation, so it might map to cardiomegaly or hyperinflation itself.

4. **pulmonary edema due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: Ardis is a condition, so this term doesn't directly translate. It seems more like a description, not a medical term in the first list. So maybe there's no match here.

5. **spine dextrocurvature**: This relates to spinal curvature, which isn't present in the first terminology. No corresponding terms here.

6. **bronchiectasis**: This is a lung condition; looking at the first terms, bronchiectasis appears as (1) bronchiectasis (morphologic abnormality) and (2) branched Bronchitis. So these can map to bronchiectasis.

7. **fibrotic scarring**: This refers to fibrotic scarring, which isn't present in the first terms. No matches here.

8. **heart size is normal**: This term doesn't appear in the first list. No mapping possible.

9. **acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: Again, this seems like a condition rather than a medical term from the first set. So no corresponding Y terms.

10. **mild cardiomegaly**: This directly maps to mild cardiomegaly in the first terminology. So mild cardiomegaly is mapped to mild cardiomegaly.

11. **thoracic spondylosis**: This term doesn't appear in the first list, so no Y terms here.

12. **ards**: As mentioned earlier, this is a condition and doesn't match any medical term from the first set. So no mapping.

13. **infiltrate in the right middle lobe**: Not present in the first terminology, so nothing maps to this.

14. **heart enlargement (pulmonary edema)**: Similar to the 'ARDS' case; it's a condition, not a medical term from the first set.

15. **left diaphragm elevation**: This is about diaphragm movement and doesn't match any terms in the first list.

So putting this all together, I'll go through each second-term phraseone by one and see which Y terms they map to.

hyperinflated lungs -> cardiomegaly, hyperinflation  
flattened diaphragm -> (1) flattened diaphragm (morphologic abnormality), (2) flattened diaphragm (diastereomony)  
increased retrosternal airspace -> cardiomegaly, hyperinflation  
pulmonary edema due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) -> no corresponding terms  
spine dextrocurvature -> no corresponding terms  
bronchiectasis -> bronchiectasis (morphologic abnormality), branched Bronchitis  
fibrotic scarring -> no corresponding terms  
heart size is normal -> no corresponding terms  
acute respiratory distress syndrome -> no corresponding terms  
mild cardiomegaly -> mild cardiomegaly  
thoracic spondylosis -> no corresponding terms  

**Note:** In this mapping, terms in the second set that don't have a direct equivalent in the first set are marked with "no corresponding terms."
