Alright, I need to figure out how to approach this query about finding terms with similar meanings in a given list of medical terms. The user has provided a list of specific terms and wants me to map each term to others that have the same or related meanings.

First, I'll look at each term one by one and try to understand what they mean. Starting with "Paratracheal lymphadenopathy (UMLS)", it's about lymph nodes in the para-tracheal region being enlarged. The UMLS probably refers to a controlled vocabulary for names of diseases, so that's a note but not part of the mapping.

Next is "Cardiomegaly". This term refers to an enlargement of the heart. I remember seeing this term before; it often occurs in conditions like cardiomyopathy or heart failure.

Then we have several instances of "NORMAL", which seems straightforwardâ€”it could be normal size, function, etc., but since it's repeated, maybe it just indicates no specific issue is noted here. But for mapping purposes, perhaps I should consider if other terms are about the same thing as normality, but in this list, they might not be.

"Lung hypoinflation" refers to reduced lung volume, which could be due to pursed-lipped syndrome or certain heart conditions. I need to find similar terms that describe reduced lung expansion.

"Cardiac Hypertrophy" is an enlargement of the heart muscle, typically cardiomyopathy. This seems very similar to "Cardiomegaly". They both relate to heart size increase. So these two should map to each other.

Thoracic spondylosis refers to a condition where the thoracic spine (upper back) has degenerative changes and possible fractures. I'm not sure if any other term in this list relates directly, but perhaps "spondylosis" is a similar term if it were present.

"Lung hyperinflation" is the opposite of hypoinflation; it refers to increased lung volume beyond normal limits, often seen in conditions like pulmonary fibrosis. I don't see another term that exactly describes this, so maybe it only maps to itself unless there's another related term.

"Abnormally opaque structure (morphologic abnormality)" suggests a structure that is not translucent, possibly referring to masses or tumors with increased density. This could map to terms describing tumors or densities in imaging findings.

The next "cardiomegaly" is the same as before, so it maps similarly.

"Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)" refers to an abnormal invasion of effused fluid into lung tissue, often seen in infections like pneumonia. I'm not sure if any other term here is similar; perhaps if there were terms about pneumonia or infection, but in this case, only "infiltrate" seems related.

Now, considering each term, I need to map them based on their meanings:

- Cardiomegaly and Cardiac Hypertrophy are clearly related.
- Abnormally opaque structure relates to morphologic abnormality.
- Lung hypoinflation is similar but opposite in direction compared to hyperinflation; they might not directly map unless the context implies a range of expansion.

I should also check if any other terms relate to the same condition. For example, if "cardiomegaly" appears more than once, it's already covered. Similarly, "Abnormally opaque structure" and "morphologic abnormality" are somewhat similar but not exact synonyms; however, in medical terminology, they might be considered related.

I need to make sure each term is mapped correctly without adding extra explanations or examples. The output should be concise with only the mappings.

Here is the mapping of terms based on their meanings:

- **Paratracheal lymphadenopathy (UMLS)** ->  
- **Cardiomegaly** -> NORMAL, Cardiac Hypertrophy  
- **NORMAL** ->  
- **Lung hypoinflation** -> Morphologic abnormality  
- **Cardiac Hypertrophy** -> Cardiomegaly  
- **Thoracic spondylosis** ->  
- **Lung hyperinflation** ->  
- **Abnormally opaque structure (morphologic abnormality)** -> Abnormal opacity  
- **cardiomegaly** -> NORMAL, Cardiac Hypertrophy  
- **Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)** -> Morphologic abnormality
