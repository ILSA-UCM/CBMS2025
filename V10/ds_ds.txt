Okay, so I need to figure out which of these medical terms are synonyms or have similar meanings. Let's go through each one step by step.

First term: mild cardiomegality. That means the heart is enlarged but not severely. So maybe other terms describing an enlarged heart would be similar. Hmm, I don't immediately think of another specific term for mild enlargement, so perhaps this stands alone. But wait, sometimes people might refer to it as "enlarged heart" or something else? Maybe not exactly.

Next: infiltrate in the right lower lobe. Infiltration usually refers to the spread of a substance through body tissue. Right lower lobe could be referring to the lung area. So maybe another term for lung infiltration would be something like "pulmonary infiltration." But I'm not sure if that's one of the terms listed.

Third term: thoracic spondylosis. That refers to a condition where there are degenerative changes in the spine around the thoracic (chest) region, right? So maybe similar terms could be "spondylolisthesis" or something else related to spinal issues in the chest area. Wait, but I don't see those options here.

Fourth term: mild hyperexpansion of the lungs. Hyperexpansion means the lungs are enlarged. So combining that with mild and lungs, perhaps another term is "pulmonary hyperexpansion." That sounds similar. Yes, so mild hyperexpansion could be referred to as pulmonary hyperexpansion.

Fifth term: stable right paratracheal prominence. Paratracheal prominence refers to the area around the trachea. Right would mean it's on the right side of the chest. Stable means it's not changing much. I think another way to say this might be "right tracheal prominence," but since the term is already specific, maybe there isn't a different term here.

Sixth term: calcified lymph node. Calcified means it has become hard. So a lymph node that's hard due to mineralization would fit. I don't think there's another term listed for this specifically.

Seventh term: diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity. Diffuse meaning widespread, and airspace opacity refers to the lung areas. Right lower lobe is the same as before. Maybe another way to describe it could be "right lower lung opacity," but again, I'm not sure if that's an option here.

So compiling this:

- mild cardiomegality: I think there might not be a direct synonym in the list provided.
- infiltrate right lower lobe: maybe not directly matching any other term listed.
- thoracic spondylosis: similar terms would involve spine issues, but none seem to match here.
- mild hyperexpansion of the lungs: this could also be called pulmonary hyperexpansion.
- stable right paratracheal prominence: no direct synonym in the list.
- calcified lymph node: same as before, no synonyms listed.
- diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity: maybe another term is "right lower lung opacity," but since that's not an option, perhaps it stands alone.

So I'll map those accordingly. Only mild hyperexpansion of the lungs has a similar term in the list.

mild cardiomegality ->  
infiltrate in the right lower lobe ->  
thoracic spondylosis ->  
mild hyperexpansion of the lungs -> pulmonary hyperexpansion  
stable right paratracheal prominence ->  
calcified lymph node ->  
diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity ->
