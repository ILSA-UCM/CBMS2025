Okay, so I've been given a list of medical terms and I need to find which ones have similar meanings. Let me go through each term one by one.

Starting with "Abnormally opaque structure (morphologic abnormality)". Morphologic abnormality generally refers to something that's not normal in shape or structure. So maybe other morphologic terms would fit here, like "Anomalous structure". But wait, the others are more specific about lungs and heart. Hmm, perhaps I should look for other morphological terms related to structures.

Next is "Lung hyperinflation". Hyperinflation means the lungs are inflated beyond normal limits. The term "Lung hyperinflation" itself is pretty specific, but maybe it's similar to something else like "Expiratory obstruction"? But no, that might be more about airway resistance during exhalation.

Then we have "NORMAL". That's just an adjective, so probably nothing else relates to it in this context. It's the default state, so no synonyms here.

"Lung hypoinflation" is the opposite of hyperinflation. So maybe similar terms would include "Lung hypoxia", but that refers more to oxygen levels than volume. Not sure if they're directly related.

"Thoracic spondylosis" refers to degeneration or sclerosis of the thoracic spine, which is a skeletal issue, not directly related to lung structures. So probably no similar terms here except maybe "Spinal abnormalities", but that's broader and might include more than just the thoracic area.

"Paratracheal lymphadenopathy (UMLS)" refers to enlarged lymph nodes in the areas near the trachea. Similar terms would be other types of lymph node disorders, like "Lymphatic enlargement" or "Lymph node hypertrophy", but I'm not sure if those are included here.

"Cardiomegaly" is enlarged heart muscle. So similar terms could include "Heart enlargement" or "Cardiac hypoplasia". Maybe "Pulmonary stenosis" isn't related, though; that's about the lungs.

"Cardiac Hypertrophy" refers to thickening and enlargement of the heart muscles due to various reasons like hypertension. So maybe other hypertrophic conditions? But in this list, it's paired with cardiomegaly, so perhaps they are synonyms or closely related terms.

"Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)" is an abnormal accumulation of cells in the lungs. Similar terms could be "Lung infection" if considering areas infected, but that might be a broader category. Or "Lung nodule formation", which is more about solid masses.

Wait, I think I need to focus on each term and see if there are other terms with similar meanings. Let's try again:

1. Abnormally opaque structure (morphologic abnormality) - Maybe Morphology-related terms like Anomalous structure or Abnormal anatomy?

2. Lung hyperinflation - It might be related to diaphragmatic issues, but I don't think any other terms here fit.

3. NORMAL - No similar terms in the list; it's just a state.

4. Lung hypoinflation - Similar could be hypoxia of lungs? Or maybe anemoclonic respiratory failure, but not listed.

5. Thoracic spondylosis - Not related to lungs or heart structures; probably no synonyms here.

6. Paratracheal lymphadenopathy (UMLS) - Maybe other lymph node enlargement terms like Mediastinitis?

7. Cardiomegaly and Cardiac Hypertrophy are both about heart enlargement, so they should be linked together.

8. Pulmonary Infiltrate is about lung inflammation; maybe similar to "Lung nodule" if considering formations, but not sure.

I think that's the best I can do without more information.

Abnormally opaque structure (morphologic abnormality) -> Anomalous structure  
Lung hyperinflation ->  
NORMAL ->  
Lung hypoinflation ->  
Thoracic spondylosis ->  
Paratracheal lymphadenopathy (UMLS) -> Mediastinitis  
Cardiomegaly, Cardiac Hypertrophy ->  
Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS) ->
