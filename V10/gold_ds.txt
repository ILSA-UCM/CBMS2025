Alright, so I've got this task where I need to align two medical terminologies that use different terms. The first part gives me a list of terms from the first terminology and some descriptions, while the second part does the same for the second terminology. My goal is to map each term in the second terminology to one or more corresponding terms in the first one based on their meanings.

First, I'll look at each term in the second terminology and try to find similar terms in the first list. Let me go through them one by one.

1. **mild cardiomegality**: This seems like it refers to a slight enlargement of the heart. In the first list, there's "cardiomegaly," which is a more general term for heart enlargement. So, maybe "cardiomegaly" would be the best match here.

2. **infiltrate in the right lower lobe**: This sounds like a type of lung infection or abnormal growth spreading into the lungs. In the first list, I see "Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)" and "Paratracheal lymphadenopathy (UMLS)." The latter is about lymph nodes, so probably not related directly to infiltration in the lung. So maybe only "Pulmonary Infiltrate" is relevant here.

3. **thoracic spondylosis**: This term I'm less familiar with. It refers to spondylosis, which affects the spine and surrounding structures. In the first list, there's nothing directly about spinal issues except "normal," so maybe it doesn't have a direct equivalent in the first terminology.

4. **mild hyperexpansion of the lungs**: This is about an abnormal increase in lung volume, which would cause hyperinflation. The first term that comes to mind is "Lung hyperinflation" and possibly "Lung hyperinflation" again since it's mild as well.

5. **stable right paratracheal prominence**: This seems like a structure on the trachea on the right side of the chest. In the first list, I don't see any direct equivalent terms related to that specific structure.

6. **calcified lymph node**: A lymph node that has calcified (turned into stone-like tissue). The first term is "Paratracheal lymphadenopathy," which refers specifically to lymph nodes in the paratracheal area, so maybe that's a match here.

7. **diffuse right lower lobe opacity**: This describes a spread of abnormal densities in the lower right lung region. In the first list, there's no term directly related to this, except perhaps "Pulmonary Infiltrate," but I think "opacity" is more specific than just an infiltration.

So compiling all these thoughts, here's how each term from the second list maps:

- mild cardiomegality -> cardiomegaly
- infiltrate in the right lower lobe -> pulmonary infiltrate
- thoracic spondylosis -> no match
- mild hyperexpansion of the lungs -> lung hyperinflation
- stable right paratracheal prominence -> no match
- calcified lymph node -> paratracheal lymphadenopathy
- diffuse right lower lobe opacity -> no match

I think that's it. Some terms don't have direct matches, so they won't appear in the output.

mild cardiomegality -> cardiomegaly  
infiltrate in the right lower lobe -> pulmonary infiltrate  
thoracic spondylosis -> (with the right part empty)  
mild hyperexpansion of the lungs -> lung hyperinflation  
stable right paratracheal prominence -> (with the right part empty)  
calcified lymph node -> paratracheal lymphadenopathy  
diffuse right lower lobe opacity -> (with the right part empty)
