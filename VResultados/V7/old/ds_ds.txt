Alright, let me try to figure out how to align these two medical terminologies. Both lists are exactly the same, so that's interesting. The user wants each term from the second terminology mapped to similar terms in the first one.

I notice that every term in both lists is identical. So for each X in the second list, there should be a corresponding Y in the first list with the exact same wording. That means each line will just map X directly to itself because they're the same terms.

I don't see any differences or variations between the two terminologies provided. Therefore, every term maps perfectly without any need for alternatives or multiple mappings. I'll structure the output as required, listing each second terminology term followed by its exact match from the first terminology.

heart mildly enlarged -> heart mildly enlarged
left hemidiaphragm elevated -> left hemidiaphragm elevated
infiltrate in the right lower lobe -> infiltrate in the right lower lobe
thoracic spondylosis -> thoracic spondylosis
low lung volumes without focal consolidation, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion -> low lung volumes without focal consolidation, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion
diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity -> diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity
mildly hyperexpanded lungs -> mildly hyperexpanded lungs
