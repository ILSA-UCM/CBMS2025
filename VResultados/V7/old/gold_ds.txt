Okay, so I have this problem where I need to align two medical terminologies that use different terms. The first step is to understand what each term means and see if there's a corresponding match in the other terminology.

Starting with the second terminology, let's take each term one by one.

First term: "heart mildly enlarged". Looking at the first terminology, I immediately notice "Cardiac Hypertrophy" and "cardiomegaly" which both refer to an enlarged heart. So this should map to those two terms.

Next is "left hemidiaphragm elevated". The first terminology doesn't have a specific term for diaphragm elevation, so this one might not have a match. I'll leave it empty unless I find something similar later.

Third term: "infiltrate in the right lower lobe". In the first terminology, there's "Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)", which seems to directly correspond to lung infiltrates regardless of location. So this maps to that term.

Fourth term: "thoracic spondylosis". The first terminology also has "Thoracic spondylosis", so it's a direct match here.

Fifth term: "low lung volumes without focal consolidation, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion". Looking through the first list, I see "Lung hypoinflation" which refers to low lung volumes. So this maps to that term.

Sixth term: "diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity". The first terminology has "Abnormally opaque structure (morphologic abnormality)" and "Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)". Both could relate to opacities in the lungs, so I'll include both here.

Seventh term: "mildly hyperexpanded lungs". This directly relates to "Lung hyperinflation" in the first terminology, which refers to over-inflated lungs. So this maps there.

Lastly, checking if any terms were missed or need adjustment. "Paratracheal lymphadenopathy (UMLS)" is in the first list but none of the second terms relate to it, so no mapping needed for that.

heart mildly enlarged -> Cardiac Hypertrophy,cardiomegaly
left hemidiaphragm elevated -> 
infiltrate in the right lower lobe -> Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)
thoracic spondylosis -> Thoracic spondylosis
low lung volumes without focal consolidation, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion -> Lung hypoinflation
diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity -> Abnormally opaque structure (morphologic abnormality),Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)
mildly hyperexpanded lungs -> Lung hyperinflation
