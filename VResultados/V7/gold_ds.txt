Okay, so I need to align these two medical terminologies. The first step is to understand what each term means and then find the best matches between them.

Starting with "heart mildly enlarged" from the second terminology. In the first list, there's "Cardiomegaly," which directly refers to an enlarged heart. So that's a clear match. Also, "Cardiac Hypertrophy" is present, which relates to the thickening of the heart muscle, often leading to enlargement. So both terms seem relevant.

Next up is "left hemidiaphragm elevated." Looking at the first terminology, I don't see any terms related to diaphragm elevation. The closest might be "Lung hypoinflation" or "Abnormally opaque structure," but those don't specifically refer to the diaphragm. So maybe there's no direct match here.

"Infiltrate in the right lower lobe" seems similar to "Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)" from the first list. That should be a straightforward mapping since both mention infiltrates, even though one specifies the location.

Moving on to "thoracic spondylosis." Both lists have this term exactly, so that's an easy match without any doubts.

For "low lung volumes without focal consolidation, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion," I think about terms related to decreased lung volume. The first list has "Lung hypoinflation," which fits because it indicates under-inflated lungs leading to lower volumes. So that's the connection here.

"Diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity." In the first terminology, there's no exact match mentioning airspace or diffusion, but "Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)" could relate since infiltrates can cause opacities. Maybe also "Abnormally opaque structure," as it indicates some morphologic change causing opacity.

"Opacities in the angulate." This seems to refer to a specific area with opacities. Again, "Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)" and "Abnormally opaque structure" come to mind since they both describe areas of abnormal opacity without specifying location, which might be the closest matches.

Lastly, "mildly hyperexpanded lungs." The first list has "Lung hyperinflation," which is about over-inflated lungs. So that's a direct match here.

heart mildly enlarged -> Cardiomegaly,Cardiac Hypertrophy  
left hemidiaphragm elevated ->   
infiltrate in the right lower lobe -> Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS)  
thoracic spondylosis -> Thoracic spondylosis  
low lung volumes without focal consolidation, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion -> Lung hypoinflation  
diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity -> Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS),Abnormally opaque structure (morphologic abnormality)  
opacities in the angulate -> Pulmonary Infiltrate (UMLS),Abnormally opaque structure (morphologic abnormality)  
mildly hyperexpanded lungs -> Lung hyperinflation
