Okay, so I have this task where I need to align two medical terminologies. Both lists are identical, which is a bit confusing because usually when you're asked to map terms from one terminology to another, they should be different. But in this case, both the first and second terminologies are exactly the same.

First, let me read through each term carefully. Each line has the same terms on both sides, like "heart mildly enlarged" appearing in both lists. So, when I need to map each term X from the second terminology to terms Y in the first, it's essentially mapping each term to itself because they are identical.

I wonder if there's a mistake here. Maybe the user intended for the two terminologies to be different? But based on what's provided, both are the same. So, I'll proceed with that assumption.

For each term X in the second list, I should provide Y from the first list where their meanings are similar. Since they're exactly the same, each X will map directly to itself. That means every line will be something like "heart mildly enlarged -> heart mildly enlarged".

I need to make sure there's no additional text or explanationsâ€”just the output as specified. Each term gets its own line, and if a term in the second terminology doesn't have a match in the first, it would appear as X ->. But in this case, since all terms are present in both, I won't need to handle any missing mappings.

So, I'll structure each line by taking each term from the second list and appending the same term from the first list after the arrow. Since they're identical, each mapping is straightforward without needing any further analysis or synonyms.
