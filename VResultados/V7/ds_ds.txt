Okay, so I need to figure out which terms in this list have similar meanings and map each one to others that are alike. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at "heart mildly enlarged." That sounds like cardiomegaly, so maybe another term could be something like "cardiomegaly" if it were here, but I don't see an exact match in the list. So probably no similar terms for this one.

Next is "left hemidiaphragm elevated." An elevated diaphragm can indicate things like atelectasis or maybe some obstruction. Looking through the list, I don't see another term that directly relates to diaphragm elevation. So, it might not have any similar terms here.

"Infiltrate in the right lower lobe" refers to an area where there's some sort of infiltration, which could be due to infection, inflammation, or other processes. Another term that seems related is "diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity," as both refer to opacities or infiltrates in the same region. So these two should be connected.

Moving on to "thoracic spondylosis." This is a condition affecting the spine, specifically the thoracic vertebrae, so it's related to degenerative changes. I don't see another term here that refers to spinal issues, so this one probably doesn't have any similar terms in the list.

"Low lung volumes without focal consolidation, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion." This sounds like a general statement about lung volume being low but without specific complications. The term "mildly hyperexpanded lungs" might seem opposite at first, but if we think about it, both could relate to overall lung volume changes, though one is low and the other is hyperexpanded. However, I'm not sure they're similar in meaning because one refers to reduced volume and the other to increased. Alternatively, "low lung volumes" might be connected with "diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity" if that's causing the volume to appear low on imaging. Wait, but no, maybe it's better to think that without consolidation or effusion, so perhaps "mildly hyperexpanded lungs" is a separate finding.

Then we have "diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity," which I've already considered in relation to "infiltrate." So these two should be linked together. 

The term "opacities in the angulate" is a bit unclear because of the word "angulate." Maybe it's referring to opacities near the angle of the lung or diaphragm? If that's the case, then perhaps this could relate to "diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity," but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's related to another term like "infiltrate in the right lower lobe" if they're both showing opacities in similar areas.

Wait, actually, "opacities in the angulate" might refer to a specific region near the diaphragm or heart border. If so, perhaps this is more about location rather than the nature of the opacity. But without more context, it's tricky. Maybe it doesn't have any other similar terms here.

So summarizing:

- "heart mildly enlarged" -> (no similar terms)
- "left hemidiaphragm elevated" -> (none)
- "infiltrate in the right lower lobe" -> "diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity"
- "thoracic spondylosis" -> (none)
- "low lung volumes..." -> Maybe not connected to others as they specify absence of certain issues
- "mildly hyperexpanded lungs" -> Possibly no direct similar terms here, but maybe it's related to other volume changes?
Wait, I think earlier I thought about it being opposite to low volumes. Alternatively, if the lungs are hyperexpanded, perhaps that's a different finding altogether.

Wait, no, actually, looking again, "low lung volumes without focal consolidation..." and "mildly hyperexpanded lungs" both describe overall lung volume but in opposite directions. So they might not be similar terms. Therefore, maybe each stands alone.

So "diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity" is connected to "infiltrate in the right lower lobe," as both refer to opacities or infiltrates in that area.

Wait, also, I have "opacities in the angulate." If this refers to a specific location with opacities, perhaps it's similar to the other two. So maybe "diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity" and "infiltrate in the right lower lobe" both relate to opacities, so they should be connected.

But wait, the user instruction was for each X, find Y,Z,K that are similar. So perhaps:

"infiltrate in the right lower lobe" -> "diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity"
and
"diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity" -> "infiltrate in the right lower lobe"

But what about "opacities in the angulate"? If that's another term for opacity, perhaps it could be connected as well. But since "angulate" might refer to a different location, maybe not.

Alternatively, if "opacities in the angulate" refers to opacities near the diaphragm or heart angle, and "infiltrate in the right lower lobe" is also in the lower part, perhaps they are connected. But I'm not sure without more context.

But given that, maybe it's better to link only the two that clearly refer to the same area.

So final mappings:

heart mildly enlarged ->
left hemidiaphragm elevated ->
infiltrate in the right lower lobe -> diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity
thoracic spondylosis ->
low lung volumes... ->
mildly hyperexpanded lungs ->
diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity -> infiltrate in the right lower lobe
opacities in the angulate -> (maybe nothing, unless it's similar to others)

Wait, but "opacities in the angulate" could be another term for opacities, so perhaps connect it as well.

Alternatively, maybe "diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity" and "infiltrate..." are both opacities, so they can link to each other, and also "opacities in the angulate" might be a third similar term if it's referring to opacities. But since I'm not certain about the location or exact meaning of "angulate," maybe it's safer to just connect the two that are clearly related.

But perhaps "opacities in the angulate" is another way to describe opacities elsewhere, but without more context, it's hard to say. So maybe better to leave it as not connected unless sure.

So the final mappings would be:

heart mildly enlarged ->

left hemidiaphragm elevated ->

infiltrate in the right lower lobe -> diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity

thoracic spondylosis ->

low lung volumes without focal consolidation, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion ->

mildly hyperexpanded lungs ->

diffuse right lower lobe airspace opacity -> infiltrate in the right lower lobe

opacities in the angulate ->
